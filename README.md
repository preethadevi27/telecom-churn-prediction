**# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using logistic regression and random forest**



This project predicts customer churn in the telecom sector using **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier.**  

It helps telecom companies identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling them to take proactive steps to retain them.

\## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1\. **Data Preprocessing**

&nbsp;  - Handle categorical variables

&nbsp;  - Feature scaling

&nbsp;  - Train-test split  



2\. **Model Training**

&nbsp;  - Logistic Regression

&nbsp;  - Random Forest  



3\. **Model Evaluation**

&nbsp;  - Accuracy

&nbsp;  - Precision, Recall, F1-score

&nbsp;  - Confusion Matrix

&nbsp;  - ROC-AUC score  



4\. **Comparison**

&nbsp;  - Logistic Regression (baseline model, interpretable)

&nbsp;  - Random Forest (ensemble model, higher accuracy and feature importance)
